Greetings, Kelly!

Congratulations on your excellent Module 6 Challenge! You’ve demonstrated your hacking skills, remotely accessed a victim’s machine, maintained access via a back door and cracked sensitive passwords!

You’ve done quite well with shadowing your victim. You’ve executed the commands to create a secret system user with administrative privileges, but no $HOME. You’ve assigned a password, UID, and GID to “sysd”. You've granted "sudo" access to this user. You've done well with this deliverable!

Also, you’ve done well in writing and testing your configuration update, Kelly. You’ve added the port directive to the “sshd_config” file.

Next, you've restarted sshd, exited the root account, and you've stealthily logged back into the target machine! Well done in this regard!

In the fourth step, you've somewhat demonstrated the steps to crack passwords. You've made a good effort in this regard.

Kelly, this has been an amazing opportunity for understanding how to establish a foothold and maintain access; please keep up the outstanding work and this smooth flow you’ve established!
